It uses a highly focused beam of light, a laser, to cut or engrave intricate designs on a variety of materials.<br>- Instead of using traditional cutting tools, laser cutting relies on the intense heat of the laser beam to vaporize or melt the material in a super precise way.<br><br><strong>How Does Laser Cutting Work?<br></strong><br>- Imagine a high-power laser pointer that can cut through stuff – that's basically what a laser cutter is.<br>- A laser cutter produces a concentrated beam of light, usually a CO2 laser or a fibre laser, that's guided by mirrors and lenses.<br>- This beam is aimed at the material you want to cut or engrave, and it heats up the material until it melts or vaporizes in a controlled manner.<br>- The laser cutter's computer controls the path and intensity of the laser beam, creating intricate designs and precise cuts.<br><br><strong>Types of Laser Cutting:<br></strong><br>1. CO2 Laser Cutting:<br>    - Most common type.<br>    - Uses a carbon dioxide gas mixture to create the laser beam.<br>    - Works well with materials like wood, acrylic, and paper.<br>2. Fiber Laser Cutting:<br>    - Uses a high-power fiber-optic laser.<br>    - Perfect for cutting metal, as it's incredibly precise and powerful.<br>    - Great for industrial applications.<br>3. Neodymium (Nd) and Neodymium-Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) Lasers:<br>    - Used for high-power cutting and engraving.<br>    - Suitable for cutting thicker materials and metals.<br><br><strong>Parameters in Laser Cutting:<br></strong><br>- Power: The laser's intensity, measured in watts, determines how fast it can cut through materials and the depth of the engraving.<br>- Speed: The rate at which the laser moves along the material – faster speeds for light cuts, slower for deep cuts.<br>- Frequency/Pulse Rate: Controls the number of laser pulses per second, affecting the smoothness and precision of the cut.<br>- Focus: Adjusting the focus of the laser beam helps control the depth of the cut.<br>- Gas Pressure: For materials like metal, an assist gas like oxygen or nitrogen is used to help the cutting process.<br><br><strong>Material and Design Considerations:<br></strong><br>- Material Compatibility: Different laser types are best suited for different materials, so choose your laser wisely.<br>- Thickness: The thickness of the material can affect the cut quality and the choice of laser type.<br>- Material Finish: Some materials might require a specific type of laser to avoid charring or discolouration.<br>- Design Complexity: Laser cutters can handle intricate designs, but make sure your design is vector-based for the best results.<br>- Ventilation: Laser cutting produces fumes and smoke, so you'll need proper ventilation or a filtration system.<br>- Safety: Always use safety gear, like goggles, when operating a laser cutter.<br><br><strong>Reflections about the Class<br></strong><br>- The class was an eye-opener about the versatility and precision of laser cutting technology.<br>- I was amazed by the variety of materials that can be used, from wood to acrylic to metal and even textiles.<br>- Learning about vector and raster graphics was key to understanding how to create designs that translate well to laser cutting.<br>- I can't wait to experiment and create my own laser-cut designs – the possibilities seem endless!<br><br><strong>What is CNC?<br></strong><br>- CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control.<br>- It's a technology that automates machining tools and 3D printers.<br>- Think of it as a robot sculptor or 3D printer that follows digital instructions to create precise, complex shapes.<br><br><strong>How Does it Work?<br></strong><br>- CNC machines read G-code, a programming language.<br>- G-code tells the machine where to move, how fast, and how to shape the material.<br>- CNC machines use motors, drives, and precise tools like drills, mills, or lasers.<br>- Computer software and control systems convert your design into G-code.<br>- It's like giving a robot a recipe to create a masterpiece.<br><br><strong>Types of CNC Machines<br></strong><br>1. Milling Machines- Remove material to create 2D or 3D shapes.<br>2. Lathes- Spin material and cut it with precision.<br>3. Routers- Used for cutting and shaping wood or plastics.<br>4. 3D Printers- Add material layer by layer to create 3D objects.<br><br><strong>Parameters for CNC Machining<br></strong><br>- Feed Rate: How fast the tool moves.<br>- Speed: How fast the tool spins.<br>- Depth of Cut: How deep the tool goes into the material.<br>- Tool Selection: Different tools for different jobs.<br><br><strong>Material and Design Considerations<br></strong><br>- Material Choice: Consider hardness, rigidity, and heat resistance.<br>- Fixturing: How to hold your material in place.<br>- Tolerances: How precise your design needs to be.<br>- Toolpath Strategy: Plan the order and direction of cuts for efficiency.<br>- Coolant: Prevent overheating and friction.<br>- Design for CNC: Avoid sharp corners, consider tool size, and minimize unnecessary complexity.<br><br><strong>Reflections about the Class<br></strong><br>- The control and precision you have over materials are nuts.<br>- Learning about G-code and toolpath strategies is something I need to do<br>- Material selection is crucial; it can make or break your project.<br>- The class made me appreciate the craftsmanship behind CNC machining and its role in modern manufacturing.<br><br>In the class, we also looked at all the machines and formed small groups to ideate on the types of things we can do with these machines and a simple tilt sensor.</p>
